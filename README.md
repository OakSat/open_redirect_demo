Testing for open redirect vulnerabilities in a website should only be done on systems you have permission to test, such as your own web applications or those you have explicit authorization to assess. Unauthorized testing of websites can be illegal and may result in serious consequences. Always obtain permission before conducting any security testing.

Assuming you have permission to test a website, here are some steps you can follow to check for open redirect vulnerabilities:

1. Identify Potential Parameters:

Look for parameters in URLs that might be vulnerable to open redirect attacks. Common parameters include redirect, url, next, etc.
Testing with a Known URL:

Try using a known URL as the parameter value. For example:


    https://www.example.com/redirect?url=https://www.google.com



If the website redirects to the specified URL, it might be vulnerable.
Relative Paths:

Experiment with relative paths:

    https://www.example.com/redirect?url=/malicious/path




If the website redirects to the specified path, it might be vulnerable.
External Domain Redirects:

Attempt to redirect to an external domain:

    https://www.example.com/redirect?url=https://malicious-site.com




If the website redirects to an external domain, it might be vulnerable.
Double URL Encoding:


    https://www.example.com/redirect?url=%252Fmalicious%252Fpath




Some applications may not properly decode the parameter, leading to open redirect vulnerabilities.
Payloads with Different Schemes:

Experiment with different schemes in the URL:

    https://www.example.com/redirect?url=ftp://malicious-site.com




Some applications may not properly validate the URL scheme, allowing open redirects.
Check for Whitelisting:

If the application is supposed to redirect only to specific domains, try bypassing by using different subdomains or variations.
Test for Open Redirect Chains:

Check if the application allows multiple redirects in sequence. For example:

    https://www.example.com/redirect?url=https://www.intermediate.com&url=https://www.malicious.com




Verify Server Responses:

Inspect the HTTP response codes. A proper redirect should return a 3xx status code (e.g., 301, 302).
Use Automated Tools:

There are automated tools available that can help scan for common web vulnerabilities, including open redirects. However, manual testing is crucial for a thorough assessment.
Remember that open redirect vulnerabilities can have serious consequences, such as phishing attacks or spreading malware. Always follow responsible disclosure practices and report any vulnerabilities to the website owner or administrator.
